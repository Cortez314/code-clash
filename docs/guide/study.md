# Things to Study

## Raylib and its dependencies

[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) is library we're gonna use to make the game itself, you can think of this library as a Game Engine similar to Godot and Unity, but its too "primitive", because we need to code our own game logics, shape rendering, inputs and so on; but the library itself is super easy if you know **C** Programming Language.

[Raygui](https://www.raylib.com/) is a part of Raylib to make a simple GUI using Raylib.
